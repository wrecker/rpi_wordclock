Set locales
+++++++++++

Since the config-file contains layouts for multiple languages, assure to have a utf-8 compatible locale::

    echo $LANG

should return something, containing utf-8 at the end.
E.g.::

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Install 3rd-party dependencies (compiled on your own).

Install rpi_ws281x to your home-directory (to access leds)::

    cd ~
    git clone https://github.com/jgarff/rpi_ws281x.git
    cd rpi_ws281x
    sudo scons
    cd ~/rpi_ws281x/python
    sudo python setup.py install

.. note::
    Since this library is continiously updated: A version, which is tested to work with the wordclock is commit 2f9e03c45:
    https://github.com/jgarff/rpi_ws281x/tree/2f9e03c45ba0964029204db565ad9d6233b3a1a6

.. _wordclock_software:

The wordclock software
++++++++++++++++++++++

.. _download_software:

Download software
-----------------

Clone the wordclock software to the directory ~/rpi_wordclock (to run the actual wordclock)::

    cd ~
    git clone https://github.com/bk1285/rpi_wordclock.git

.. _adopt_software:

Adopt software
--------------

To adjust the wordclock to your own settings, create and edit the file ~/rpi_wordclock/config/wordclock_config.cfg

To start over, you might just copy the file ~/rpi_wordclock/config/wordclock_config.example.cfg and adopt this file.

Note: Each plugin of the wordclock project has its own section in the config-file (create it, if needed, but not existant)

.. note:: If your wordclock has a stencil layout or display resolution, which is not supported yet, you might need to adopt the
  software by providing your own `wiring`-class (to the file tools/wiring.py)


.. _run_software:

Run software
------------

To run the wordclock software (with adapted wiring and config-file) do::

    cd ~/rpi_wordclock
    sudo python wordclock.py

In case, the whole thing is not working as expected: Maybe the section :ref:`trouble-shooting` might help...


.. _run_software_on_startup:

Make software run on every startup
----------------------------------

Add the python-script to crontab by calling the command::

    sudo crontab -e

Add here::

    @reboot sudo python /home/pi/rpi_wordclock/wordclock.py

Access the wordclock via webinterface
-------------------------------------

Visit the wordclocks webinterface by entering the wordclocks IP to your browers address bar.
